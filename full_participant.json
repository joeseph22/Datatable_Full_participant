There are some days in my current role when I feel like I need a change, and some days when I think I could do this long term.  One reason for wanting to change would be that I&sbquo;m a very practical person (Myers-Briggs ISFP) who finds value in tangible results, but I work in a field that orients itself primarily around abstract concepts.  At the same time, the times I enjoy my current role are when I see the opportunity to help it grow into something bigger than what it is (working &quot;on the business&quot; as opposed to being just a policy wonk\/project manager).\n","r":"Need a change","s":"A combination of: (a) being comfortable enough in my current role, and (b) not knowing what to consider next.  The problem is that I have a lot of varied interests but they don&sbquo;t match up with anything where I have professional experience on paper, and they&sbquo;re not necessarily even things that I might be able to make a paying career out of.","t":"Being comfortable","u":"Arts\/sports\/entertainment (either in a business or creative role), film production, data analytics, hospitality\/travel, although I&sbquo;m open to most industries.","v":"I&sbquo;ve tried a number of options over the past couple of years (life coaching, etc.) to help me gain clarity as to next steps.  I&sbquo;ve reached a stage in my career and at my current organization where I need to decide whether I&sbquo;m growing toward my fullest potential or if I need to make a change.  And if the latter, how to go about doing that.","w":"I can be a Team Lead, but only if you really need one","x":"It takes me some time to warm up and feel comfortable sharing","y":"A fair amount.","z":"","aaa":"Week 1 Feedback","aab":"For as much pre-work as there was prior to Week 1, I felt like I knew what was going on once I understood how to work the technology platforms.","aac":"I think I understand the tech so far.  I wasn&sbquo;t a huge fan of having to create yet another account (for Gravitar) just to make a profile for Slack (in addition to new credentials already for Teachable and Slack).  As a separate note, if I hadn&sbquo;t already been familiar with Slack, I might have had a rough go this first week.","aad":"3","aae":"Having the time estimates for the modules helped a lot.  However, I felt I could have used more time to fill out my feedback for my partner&sbquo;s 1.8 form.  Since it was distracting to try to fill it out during the phone call itself, I saved my notes to type up (with my added reflections) for the weekend.  The problem is waiting until then put my partner at a disadvantage if she wanted to work on her week 2 homework early.","aaf":"1.8 I felt that having an actual accountability partner would drive me to complete things on time (or as close to on time as possible)","aag":"Relatively speaking, probably the welcomes 1.1 + 1.2, but they&sbquo;re still valuable and of appropriate length.","aah":"I appreciated the groupings for the team call.  It helped me reflect on my current thoughts on career options and made me reconsider some of my assumptions.","aai":"Unfortunately, we weren&sbquo;t able to get everyone in on the team call (one person didn&sbquo;t join until too late, one had issues with camera).  Not sure if that can be fixed from the program end.","aaj":"8","aak":"","aal":"Week 2 feedback","aam":"4","aan":"I was slightly under the gun this week, since I was at a work conference for the week. Getting my profile done with enough time for my partner to read it and give feedback was the most difficult part.","aao":"The 2.3 profile was the most helpful because it forced me to rank considerations and it also made it easier to provide feedback during the team call because it was a consistent, yet brief, format.","aap":"Not a particular module, but I will say that one problem is that my feelings and state of mind on a given day can sway my the order of my priorities. In other words, it??s hard for me to look at my profile as ??static?? for more than a couple days at a time.","aaq":"I feel like I have some areas to investigate, to start.","aar":"I wasn??t aware until the team call that there was a directory of other participants in this cohort who aren??t necessarily in my small group. Not sure how I missed that.","aas":"8","aat":"","aau":"Week 3 Feedback","aav":"3","aaw":"This was the most difficult week of material (3.2 and 3.3 in particular, because it forced us to &quot;commit&quot; to a direction, so to speak), so I appreciated the relatively light *amount* of work to balance it out.","aax":"3.3, because of the table that showed what areas certain paths would fix vs. areas they wouldn&sbquo;t fix.  It helped me understand what I need to find out to see if staying in my current organization will make sense in the long run.","aay":"3.2, because I already had a fair idea of what my top choices were.","aaz":"The team call went really well because it helped me to realize that **my next stop doesn&sbquo;t have to be my last stop** and that it&sbquo;s ok not to land the dream job right now maybe improvement of my situation is fine at this point.","bba":"However, scheduling issues for our team made it so only two of us could be on the team call.  We&sbquo;ve kind of struggled with attrition having lost one member altogether already.","bbb":"9","bbc":"","bbd":"Week 4 and Final","bbe":"5","bbf":"Week 4 turned out to be the one that broke me.  Partially because I didn&sbquo;t feel great about the choices I made in Week 3, but mostly because of the timing with the Labor Day holiday (will explain more below).","bbg":"I like the concept of the test plan (4.2), especially how it laid everything out on a spectrum from least to most helpful.  That mental model was useful.","bbh":"I&sbquo;m still not fully convinced about the idea of a test project.  There are a lot of &quot;cool&quot; things I might like about a particular path (for example, chasing bad guys as a bounty hunter sounds appealing to me), but those things if they are what I focused my test project on wouldn&sbquo;t necessarily be the bulk of the job.  I suppose that&sbquo;s why it&sbquo;s also important to get feedback from practitioners, but I would hate to go through a 1-3 week project to find out that there are a lot of other things about the job that I would hate.","bbi":"I do like the idea of the test plan.  Even though I haven&sbquo;t completed it yet, at least I know what I need to do once life calms down for a minute.","bbj":"Timing.  Having this week run into the last week of the summer killed our group&sbquo;s momentum.  Folks were either on vacation and couldn&sbquo;t join in on the call, or were super-busy at work preparing for vacation that they couldn&sbquo;t get homework done (myself included).  Even shifting this cohort back a week would have made a big difference, I think.","bbk":"Pretty good","bbl":"Pretty good","bbm":"Pretty good","bbn":"Perfect for the Fellowship","bbo":"Slack kept it easy to organize communications, but I don&sbquo;t check it nearly enough on a regular basis.","bbp":"I think it was reasonable overall given the amount of content in the program.  I appreciated deadlines but felt later on that &quot;I&sbquo;m just going to have to come back to this once I have time.&quot;","bbq":"I really appreciate the ability to connect with the larger cohort keep the conversations going.","bbr":"I felt like we could have split week 1 into two weeks it&sbquo;s really difficult to get a sense of who someone else really is in one meeting.","bbs":"The general slack chat for the entire group I probably could have participated more there.","bbt":"Sort of.  I wasn&sbquo;t expecting total clarity, just progress.  I do feel like I could have done more in generating authentic relationships.","bbu":"No","bbv":"4","bbw":"10","bbx":"","bby":"","bbz":"8","cca":"More prepared"},

My job applications have been all over the place.  This gave me focus and a support network.  The career resources exceeded my expectations.","bby":"Thanks for offering this course.

I also feel all the hard work I put into teaching in my classroom, wasn??t helping to me forward in my career, especially since I don??t want to be in administration.

That being said, we had the modules for the first two weeks well in advance, so the work was certainly doable. Furthermore, the career profile built on the pre-fellowship self-reflection questions and the career criteria exercise.","aao":"2.2. It provided a way to quantify\/rank\/put into words what I am looking for in my next job.","aap":"2.5. Although the instructions said to spend no more than 5 minutes on presenting our career profiles, they didn&sbquo;t explain how to do so (e.g., what was the goal of presenting the profile to the team? what was the speaker trying to get across?), or why we were doing so at all given module 2.3 instructed us to post a link such that team members could read one another&sbquo;s profiles and make comments before the call. ","aaq":"The modules helped translate vague ideas into ideas that were concrete and actionable. ","aar":"This week, half of my team had issues posting their career profiles, and a couple of members (including the team leader) missed the call and didn&sbquo;t notify the rest of us in advance (or at all). We managed to muddle through; after waiting 15 minutes, we went ahead and started given a couple of folks on the call had hard stop times. I don&sbquo;t think the facilitators can do more than they have to ensure team members understand the tech, complete assignments, and\/or show up for the calls, but it could be helpful to assign co-team leaders to ensure someone is prepared to take the helm when needed with little to no notice. \n\nIt might also be helpful to either email the Community Directory to everyone at the outset of the fellowship, or to instruct us to save it for reference in case we need to reach out to team members. (We resorted to the gmail invitation for the call to find our missing team members&sbquo; contact info because we didn&sbquo;t think to use the Directory; had we remembered, I don&sbquo;t know that we would also have remembered it was posted on Slack. Quite frankly, I am not sure that all of my teammates have thus far even used Slack . . . ) \n\nTo the extent it is possible to share our screens on Hangouts, it would be good to know how to do so (I tried without success) such that we could use it to present documents (or even to help each other with tech issues). \n\nFinally, it would be great if a link to the team calls was included in the invitation that would populate in an electronic calendar. If that is not possible, it would be helpful to instruct us to keep the invitation with the link handy.\n\nI hope this is useful feedback (and not totally nit-picky!!).","aas":"10","aat":"","aau":"Week 3 Feedback","aav":"3","aaw":"Just the right amount not front-loaded, and it built on the work we did the previous two weeks.","aax":"3.3.

While I think it's great to have input from people who may have different backgrounds\/careers, I think it can be a bit challenging for people who aren't in your field to offer suggestions. For me, I think there's a bit of a myth out there as to how flexible having a law degree really is, and I felt like the suggestions that I received were mostly in that vein and sticking to more of a pivot change. In giving suggestions to other folks, I felt similar challenges of really understanding the day-to-day work\/skills and being able to give targeted suggestions that would really capitalize on that.","aaq":"I thought the Career Criteria and Career Profile modules were valuable.","aar":"I think I mentioned this last week, but maybe mixing the teams up so that there is either more of a mix between those who are looking for more of a material career change vs. career adjustment\/pivot-change, if not grouping people together along those lines.","aas":"6","aat":"","aau":"Week 3 Feedback","aav":"3","aaw":"","aax":"The calls with accountability partner have been good.

I *do* have a love and passion for higher education, specifically working at a college\/university. I love (and miss) working closely with students where I can advise them and see them grow to be the good and great humans they were called to be. I was really happy doing the advising roles I held, working with clubs\/groups, and maintaining a consistent advisory relationship with student leaders.\n\nWhen I moved to Seattle, I did so without a job or an apartment. It was time for a change both physically (I had learned the Midwest was not for me after working at Notre Dame for two years) and emotionally (I had wanted to live in Seattle for a long time, so I just did it!) It was no haphazard decision I had tried for over a year to get a job in Seattle before making the choice to move here, but nothing was coming about. I figured if I really wanted to live in a place, there was nothing holding me back from pursuing this desire.\n\nSo, when I finally did move to Seattle, I looked for jobs in the surrounding schools and colleges because that is my wheelhouse and what I felt called to do. I eventually landed a position in the Seattle University Alumni Association doing regional and chapter engagement, but always had the desire to work more with students rather than alumni. Fast forward four years and three positions later (including a rather sizable promotion), I'm sitting here, typing away after hours at my work desk, feeling really dissatisfied in my job because I feel like the job is driving me rather than the other way around.\n\nI am looking for a career change because I Do not think the alumni demographic is for me. I will acknowledge that this new leadership role is scary and is a lot of work, but I Do not feel connected to the mission or find as much value in what I do as I once did. I miss working with students, but am not as open to a position in student affairs due to their long hours and low pay. \n\nI want a career change because I want more control over my schedule with comparable pay and to feel fulfilled in my work.","r":"Need a change","s":"Fear is a huge one. Fear of failure, of putting myself out there, of coming to terms with the possibility that I'm not actually as talented as I'd like to think that I am. Fear that people will think that I'm a fraud so it's easier for me to stay in my corner and deal with dissatisfaction rather than take a risk.\n\nI over-analyze a situation and potentially psych myself out of an opportunity before I've even pursued it because I want a situation to be perfect and 100% ready and well-thought out before I go for it. It's the perfectionist in me that wants to control for everything and make sure that I feel comfortable and good in what's being asked of me.\n\nI also Do not know how to translate the skills I've gained in higher education to be more marketable in a different field. For example, you see a lot of higher education\/student affairs folks move into the business sector, working for Amazon or Google as recruiters or project managers. How did they do that? How do I make my transferable skills known and desirable within a different field?","t":"Moving out of comfort zone","u":"I'm not entirely sure if this is what I want, but sexy terms like &quot;Project Manager&quot; or &quot;Program Director&quot; seem to be what I look for in job postings.\n\nI want a job where I can build relationships with people and I can be part of their growth. Not sure if this means being a career coach or personal coach, but something where I can use my ability to connect with others to bolster their growth, one where I feel a genuine connection to an individual and what they are trying to do.","v":"- Identify fields\/sectors\/careers outside of student affairs that lend to my skill sets and make me feel fulfilled\n- The ability to verbalize and communicate my transferable skills \/ code switching my skill sets and talents to a different field (aka what is Project Manager and for-profit sector speak?)\n- The tools and resources to help me feel empowered in a targeted and intentional job search","w":"No thanks","x":"I like to jump right in and share my thoughts","y":"A fair amount.","z":"","aaa":"Week 1 Feedback","aab":"Yes!

Instructions were clear and concise. And while I didn't watch the specific videos, it was great to see that y'all provided inclusive instructions to your users.","aad":"3","aae":"The amount of time for this week seemed appropriate. I appreciated having the estimated amount of time it should take me to complete a task and being told not to go above it.","aaf":"The Life Story Map was my favorite as it was a great way to reflect on the path that got me to where I am today. It also provided great content to discuss with my team as we got to know more about each other.","aag":"While I rated Module 1.8 the lowest, it wasn't for a lack of value, but rather that there was so much content to go through with my partner that it took longer that 60 minutes. I would say it was also because my partner and I clicked so well and had so much to talk about! ","aah":"Reflecting on what I value, enjoy, and brings me to life was helpful during this phase. I specifically liked the guiding questions and opportunities to connect with others.","aai":"How can I go deeper? I feel like I'm just scratching at the surface and haven't fully identified what I'm looking for in a new job (but I also acknowledge that more is to come.)

I think my partner felt the same way with his team call and likely our partner call this week. While we both reviewed each other's profiles and brainstormed, each person seems to only come up with 1-2 ideas per teammate\/partner, and since we have no experience in each other's fields they may not be useful (although sometimes may lead to out of the box suggestions). That being the case, would it be worth it\/workable to somehow have a broader discussion, where a broader community takes a shorter look at more people's profiles to give a few quick suggestions\/ideas? I know the idea is to get to know each other, but if we can't provide much feedback maybe it is better to have a lot of people providing shallow ideas for each person to explore. Obviously might be hard if we can't also have calls to get background on each other, but as we near the halfway point I am really hoping to start getting some concrete, actionable items. I feel bad when I can't give these to my teammates, and I am hoping to gain some clarity myself.","aas":"7","aat":"","aau":"Week 3 Feedback","aav":"3","aaw":"tough but fair","aax":"had a really good call with my partner, balanced out the advice from my team, helped me re-shuffle again, trying to balance interest\/&quot;dream&quot; type changes with realistic ones, hopefully find a good middle ground","aay":"the career tests didnt really give me better information personally","aaz":"discussions with team and partner","bba":"not sure","bbb":"7","bbc":"","bbd":"Week 4 and Final","bbe":"4","bbf":"","bbg":"team call - very helpful, balanced ","bbh":"all good","bbi":"all good","bbj":"all good","bbk":"Pretty good","bbl":"Perfect for the Fellowship","bbm":"Ok","bbn":"Ok","bbo":"all good, Slides was kinda buggy","bbp":"good","bbq":"no","bbr":"partner calls, structure","bbs":"hard when teammates are mostly in a different but similar-to-each other industry - feel like it was hard to give useful feedback to each other","bbt":"I avent been able to fully complete the 5-6th weeks due to work commitments, so I feel like i am still struggling in the early stages, no real concrete action steps taken toward really changing careers","bbu":"No","bbv":"5","bbw":"7","bbx":"","bby":"","bbz":"7","cca":"The same as before"},

Most people (myself included) Do not really even know how our strengths are being used or that we have certain inherent values making us happy or unhappy in current roles.  Getting a chance to explore ourselves and discuss was huge for me.  The fellowship therefore takes on a form of therapy and I think that insight and thoughtfulness is critical to making life-altering decisions.

I&sbquo;m really frustrated - maybe disillusioned is a good word, too - about the systematic priorities that the higher-ups in education implement.  I feel we are in many ways doing a disservice to students and young people rather than preparing them.  So, part of my motivation for wanting change are because I am not feeling happy or fulfilled, and part of my motivation is trying to find a way I can move into some kind of position to address and improve educational priorities and programs.  Or to find another career where I can feel more positive about what I contribute.","r":"Unfulfilled","s":"It really has been just recent, in the past two years, that I have become frustrated.  Also, my current school is actually a good school with a supportive administration and colleagues.

But going back to school for another Masters or a Ph.D. is not something that is feasible, so I imagine those options are limited.  I think I would like to stay in the field of Education, but I also imagine my skills as a counselor would lend themselves to other careers interacting with people.  I do feel like at heart I am a &quot;helper&quot;, so I think any new career would have to have an element of that.","v":"I feel like I&sbquo;ve reached a point where doing the same thing I&sbquo;ve done for the last 23 years isn&sbquo;t what I want to do for the next 20 years of my work life.
